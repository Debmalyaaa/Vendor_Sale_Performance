## üìã Project Overview

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Load vendor-related datasets such as purchase orders, delivery logs, invoice records.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize data formats
   - Remove duplicates and fix inconsistencies

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Uncover insights on:
     - Purchase trends
     - On-time vs. delayed deliveries
     - Vendor-wise profitability

4. **SQL Analysis**
   - Write SQL queries to compute:
     - Total purchases and sales per vendor
     - On-time delivery percentage
     - Average delivery time
     - Vendor profitability metrics

5. **Python Processing**
   - Read SQL outputs
   - Feature engineering (e.g., delivery delay days)
   - Export to CSV for Power BI use

6. **Power BI Dashboards**
   - Create visual reports with:
     - Vendor comparison charts
     - Time-series trends
     - Category-wise contribution analysis
     - Filters and slicers for custom analysis

7. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Identify top vendors based on cost-efficiency and reliability
   - Detect vendors with declining performance
   - Suggest contract renegotiation or vendor replacement
